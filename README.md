# CS 583: Probabilistic Graphical Models - Spring 2020

## Official Course Description

This course will cover probabilistic graphical models -- powerful and interpretable models for reasoning under uncertainty. The generic families of models such as directed, undirected, and factor graphs as well as specific representations such as hidden Markov models and conditional random fields will be discussed. The discussions will include both the theoretical aspects of representation, learning, and inference, and their applications in many interesting fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, computational biology, and medical diagnosis.

**Important note:** This course will focus primiarly on the foundations of probabilistic graphical models (PGM). Almost all of the lecture time will be used for discussing and using probability theory, statistics, optimization, and calculus for understanding, analysis, and derivation of PGM approaches and algorithms. Programming will be minimal.

## Prerequisites

Strong background in calculus, statistics, and probability.

### Assignments

There will be approximately 7 assignments. Assignments will focus on the theory and foundations of probabilistic graphical models. There might be one programming assignment in Python.

#### Late Submission Policy

There is a 5-minute grace period. After the grace period is over, every late minute costs 1 point. The late submission policy is strictly enforced. Please do not submit late; submit early.

#### Extensions

I do not extend deadlines.

#### Extra Credit

I do not assign extra-credit work. Why? For at least two reasons:

1. Extra credit is rarely truly optional; every student feels they have to do it, and hence it becomes a required credit in practice.
2. The TAs are often overworked and underpaid.
